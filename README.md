## ❔ What is Dotpen?

Dotpen is a web-based app with a focus on speed and simplicity. Dotpen is designed to help you organize your website and make it easier to navigate. With Dotpen, you can easily create a website structure that is easy to understand and navigate and you will never loose track of your content.

## 💡 Why Dotpen?

Most bookmarking tools are slow, chunky and cluttered. Dotpen is designed to be the smartest way to organize your website. It is fast, easy to use and has a lot of features that make it the best bookmarking tool out there. We use the power of simplicity and speed to make it an ease to use.

## 💻 Stack

Dotpen is built with the following technologies:

- **Front-end**: SvelteKit v5, TailwindCSS, TS and Vite.
- **Back-end**: Golang (extended with PocketBase)
- **AI Services**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (with _soon_ support for locally hosted models.)

In the future we will try to make Dotpen switch to different backend technologies, with support for multiple concurrent users and more advanced features.
